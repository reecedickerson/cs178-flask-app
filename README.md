# [Your Project Name Here]

**CS178: Cloud and Database Systems — Project #1**
**Author:** [Reece Dickerson]
**GitHub:** [reecedickerson]

---

## Overview

<!-- Describe your project in 2-4 sentences. What does it do? Who is it for? What problem does it solve? -->

---

## Technologies Used

- **Flask** — Python web framework
- **AWS EC2** — hosts the running Flask application
- **AWS RDS (MySQL)** — relational database for [describe what you stored]
- **AWS DynamoDB** — non-relational database for [describe what you stored]
- **GitHub Actions** — auto-deploys code from GitHub to EC2 on push

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip3 install flask pymysql boto3
   ```

3. Set up your credentials (see Credential Setup below)

4. Run the app:

   ```bash
   python3 flaskapp.py
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

---

## How to Access in the Cloud

The app is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance. To view the live version:

```
http://[your-ec2-public-ip]:8080
```

_(Note: the EC2 instance may not be running after project submission.)_

---

## Credential Setup

This project requires a `creds.py` file that is **not included in this repository** for security reasons.

Create a file called `creds.py` in the project root with the following format (see `creds_sample.py` for reference):

```python
# creds.py — do not commit this file
host = "your-rds-endpoint"
user = "admin"
password = "your-password"
db = "your-database-name"
```

---

## Database Design

### SQL (MySQL on RDS)

<!-- Briefly describe your relational database schema. What tables do you have? What are the key relationships? -->

**Example:**

- `[TableName]` — stores [description]; primary key is `[key]`
- `[TableName]` — stores [description]; foreign key links to `[other table]`

The JOIN query used in this project: <!-- describe it in plain English -->

### DynamoDB

<!-- Describe your DynamoDB table. What is the partition key? What attributes does each item have? How does it connect to the rest of the app? -->

- **Table name:** `[your-table-name]`
- **Partition key:** `[key-name]`
- **Used for:** [description]

## CRUD Operations

| Operation | Route      | Description    |
| --------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Create    | `/[route]` | [what it does] |
| Read      | `/[route]` | [what it does] |
| Update    | `/[route]` | [what it does] |
| Delete    | `/[route]` | [what it does] |
